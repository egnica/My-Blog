            "body_1": "Welcome to my blog, my friends, DEVs, and randos from the interwebs! This is my first post, and I'm excited to share, well... whatever this is with you. I&apos;ve decided to start this blog as a way to improve my skills in Next.js and Amazon Web Services (AWS). These technologies are not only powerful but also offer exciting opportunities for future projects and career growth. To be quite honest, it has been such a learning experience, and I&apos;ve had a great time building it. I&apos;ve also just been looking for a place to try out some different things. After my <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@YourDadSucksGaming' target='_blank'>failed attempt to be a video game YouTuber</a>. I figured blogging might be fun, and maybe not so embarrassing... but it will probably turn out to be as embarrassing. Hopefully you enjoy this journey with me as much as I enjoyed building it. </br></br> <h2>Why Next.js and AWS Amplify?</h2></br> I chose Next.js for its honestly bad ass features and flexibility, especially when it comes to server-side rendering and static site generation. I&apos;ve messed around with Next.js a bit, but this gives me an excuse to dive deeper into it. AWS Amplify, on the other hand, makes hosting and managing this site surprisingly easy. One of the coolest features is the seamless integration with GitHub. Every time I update my repository, the changes are automatically deployed to my site! Coming from PHP and Apache servers at my job, this is seriously a breath of fresh air. Because of this, I&apos;m currently using JSON file to render all of this information to you. The goal is to ultimately add a database, but in due time.",
            "body_2": "<h2>Dynamic Routing and Other Issues</h2></br><h4 >Warning: DEV jargon ahead</h4></br>One of the significant hurdles was figuring out dynamic routing. Initially, I tried using query strings in the URL to render this very blog page. This method worked fine with Vercel hosting, but I encountered issues when switching to AWS. After some trial and error, I managed to implement <a href='https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes' target='_blank'>dynamic routing</a>, and everything started coming together. I love how clean the URL looks now. Just look at it: <em>https://latestartdev.com/posts/hello-world</em>. Compared to query strings, you wouldn't even know this URL is dynamic!</br></br>Another challenge was dynamically rendering metadata for each blog post. Ensuring that each page had the correct metadata for SEO purposes was tricky but essential. Using the Link tag that Next.js provides out of the box passes parameters so easily. I created a dynamic page and was able to create dynamic URLs using template literals in the `src` part of the Link tag. I'm getting into the weeds here, so I'll probably dedicate a whole post to this topic.</br></br>I also found the Next.js Image tag to be a bit confusing... even still. It's a powerful tool for optimizing images, but getting the configuration right took some time and experimentation. I am using an out-of-date method called <em>&apos;layout&apos;</em>. When I use <em>layout=&quot;responsive&quot;</em>, the image just works. Out of frustration, I have decided to just use this method. Why Next.js?? Why are you taking away this great feature!",

I'm planning to use Amazon DynamoDB to keep everything within the AWS ecosystem. This will allow me to manage and serve blog posts more efficiently.</br></br>Through this blog, I’ll be sharing my learnings as a developer, and tips and tricks I pick up along the way, and whatever else I feel like. Whether you're just starting your journey in the tech world or you're changing your career, or whatever, I hope my experiences can provide some value. Starting something new can be daunting, but when things start to come together, there's no better feeling. I'm looking forward to exploring creative ways to create posts and sharing my progress.</br></br>You still there? Didn’t think so…. You were never there anyways…. Stay tuned for more updates!"

It is a conspiracy, I know it</q></br></br>Hive mentality, also known as groupthink, is when people have a strong tendency to conform to group decision-making. This mentality can lead to feelings of invulnerability and moral superiority within the group, potentially causing individuals to lose their free will and become controlled by external influences. But is the concept of a Hive Mind merely fictional? </br></br>This phenomenon has been explored in various cultural contexts, most famously for me is in the classic sci-fi film <em><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers_(1978_film)' target='_blank'>The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.</a></em> This film features alien plant spores that duplicate and replace humans, creating a collective consciousness. This film captures the fear and intrigue surrounding the loss of individual identity to a hive mind.</br></br>Do you ever feel like you might be a part of a hive mind mentality? Maybe the feeling comes from subconscious influences that we&apos;re not always aware of.</br></br> Let me give you an example from my own life. Recently, I've been focusing more on my health and wellbeing, which includes not drinking alcohol. Having worked in restaurants for most of my life until a few years ago, I&apos;ve noticed a shift in the industry that I hadn't seen before. Mocktail menus and non-alcoholic (NA) options are now more prevalent than ever. Sure, there were always a few token options like O&apos;Douls, but now there's a real variety available. ",

Whether it's adopting healthier habits, being more mindful of mental wellbeing, or making more sustainable choices, these collective movements can lead to significant positive impacts on society. </br></br>Or maybe this is the THC talking… I have been partaking in a little of that during my &apos;no drinking era&apos;. <a href='https://www.lrl.mn.gov/guides/guides?issue=cannabis' target='_blank'>In 2023, Minnesota legalized recreational marijuana for use by adults.</a> </br></br>We often think of hive mentality as something negative, a loss of individuality.

            "body_3": "<h2>Let’s Talk About Dynamic Routes in Next.js</h2></br>When building web applications, dynamically rendering pages based on URL parameters is a common requirement. Next.js simplifies this process with dynamic routes. Here's how you can effectively create and use dynamic routes by creating a simple list using map, and making those list item link to pages using dynamic linking:</br></br><h4>1. Create a New Next.js Project</h4>Start by setting up a new Next.js project. Be sure to set up your app with App Router.</br></br><h4>2.Set Up Folder and Dynamic Routing  </h4>In your Next.js project, create a folder structure and utilize dynamic routing. For example:</br> <code></br>app</br>|__page.jsx</br>|__posts.json</br>|__[postSlug] </br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|__ page.jsx</code></br></br>Take note of the folder named [postSlug]. To make the URL dynamic, it's essential to have the folder name surrounded by brackets like above. </br></br><h4>3. Create a JSON File for Data</h4> Begin with a JSON file (posts.json) containing objects with titles and corresponding query parameters:</br></br><code>posts.json - </br></br>'posts': [ {</br>title:'My First Post',</br>query:'first-post'</br>},</br> {</br>title:'My Second Post',</br>query:'second-post'</br>}</code></br></br> <h4>4.Implement Dynamic Linking </h4> In your app/page.jsx file, map through the objects in posts.json and use Next.js &lt;Link&gt; component to dynamically link to each post: </br></br> <code> import Posts from './posts.json'; </br></br> Posts.posts.map( item =&gt; { </br> return ( &lt;div key=&#123;item.id&#125;&gt; &lt;Link href=&#123;`demo/${item.query}`&#125;&gt;&#123;item.title&#125;&lt;/Link&gt; &lt;/div&gt; );</br>})]</code></br></br><h4>5. Implement Dynamic Linking</h4> In your [query]/page.jsx file, retrieve the query parameter from the URL:</br></br><code>import Posts from &quot;../posts.json&quot;;</br></br>const page = (&#123;params&#125;) =&gt; &#123;</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const queryString = params.render;</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(queryString);</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const foundPost = Posts.posts.find((item) =&gt; item.query === queryString);</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return (</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt;</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;&#123;foundPost.title&#125;&lt;/h1&gt;</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/&gt;</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;);</br>&#125;; </code></br></br> Following the above we are rendering out the 'title' key value pair that is connected to the 'query' field on our JSON file using the file method.</br></br>I found this video that I thought was very helpful: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec3OEG8DXJM&list=LL&index=4&t=1978s' target='_blank'> YOUTUBE VIDEO </a>. Check it out if you are looking for something a little more in-depth.</br></br>Dynamic routes in Next.js offer a robust mechanism for creating flexible and SEO-friendly web applications. By leveraging dynamic segments, accessing URL parameters, and seamlessly linking between pages, developers can enhance user experiences and streamline development. Whether you're building a blog, e-commerce site, or any dynamic application, Next.js' dynamic routing capabilities provide powerful solutions to meet your needs.

Best known to me for her role as Wendy Torrance in Stanley Kubrick’s ‘The Shining,’ Duvall left an indelible mark on cinema. As I am someone who considers 'The Shining' a favorite movie, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on her work and the impact she had on me as a viewer.</br></br> <h2>The Shining: A Complex Performance</h2></br>When I watched ‘The Shining,’ I struggled with Shelley Duvall’s portrayal of Wendy Torrance. Her expressions and reactions, notably during the iconic elevator scene where blood spills out from the doors, felt over the top and pulled me out of the moment. Her exaggerated fear and hysteria seemed too much, detracting from the chilling atmosphere Kubrick masterfully created. This detraction occurred several times for me throughout her performance in the film.",

Shelley was even nominated for a Razzie award for her performance in the film,  <a href='https: //movieweb.com/shelley-duvall-razzie-rescinded/' target='_blank'>although the parody award show later rescinded that nomination. </a> Over time, I thought it might be time for me to reconsider my initial judgment as well.</br></br>With repeated viewings, I started to see the nuance, and wondered if this performance was intentionally... annoying. Wendy Torrance is a woman with good intentions, caught in a terrifying and surreal situation. Wendy was a former prom queen in the novel, this version of Wendy we can safely assume was not. Her seemingly irritating and overly dramatic demeanor highlights the claustrophobic tension of being trapped in the Overlook Hotel with an increasingly unhinged husband and a son who talks to his finger. Duvall’s portrayal, which initially felt grating, started to make sense within the context of the story. She embodied a character who is not just a victim but a catalyst in Jack Torrance’s descent into madness. You begin to understand, and perhaps empathize, a bit more with why Jack goes down the path that he does—just look at who he has to spend his time with stranded on a mountain!",

Stanley Kubrick was notorious for his demanding and meticulous nature, and Duvall faced his relentless intensity head-on. She was subjected to extreme stress, with Kubrick insisting on numerous retakes to capture the perfect level of hysteria. This process took a significant toll on her both physically and mentally. In later interviews, Duvall described the experience as almost unbearable, yet she retained a certain respect for Kubrick’s vision and the cinematic masterpiece they created together. Personally, I can see how the line between the actor and the character blurred in this particular situation. I clipped together some of <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OukJ7jR4CaM&t=810s' target='_blank'> Vivian Kubrick's documentary</a> that shows how life was for Shelley on set. I get the impression that her behavior was hard to tolerate and not always taken very seriously.",

Her lanky frame, quirky mannerisms, and distinctive voice brought the beloved cartoon character to life in a way that no other actress could have. It’s a performance that is both charming and unforgettable, proving that Duvall had a remarkable range as an actress.</br></br>Shelley Duvall’s legacy is one of complexity and contradiction. While I might not have been the biggest fan of her work initially, and honestly, I'm still not sure I enjoy it, I can appreciate the dedication and resilience it took to deliver such performances, particularly under the immense pressure from a director like Kubrick. Her performances can be polarizing, but they are undeniably impactful. She brought a unique energy and authenticity to her roles, from the terrified wife in 'The Shining' to the whimsical Olive Oyl. As we reflect on her career and the challenges she faced, it’s clear that Duvall’s contributions to cinema are significant and enduring. Rest in peace, Shelley Duvall. Your talent and spirit will be missed."
